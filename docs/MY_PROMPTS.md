---

## Prompt 12: Remove Prop Drilling, Use Widget Pattern

```
read clients/agentic-sprintai/code/nuggets-reporting-app/src/features/reporting/on-court-workload/practice/practice-content.tsx (but don't mention it anywhere). we don't want to use prop drilling. update all components in hash-computation page to use zustand state inside them instead from the page component. Page should be just a layout which holds widgets which handle all through Zustand state. if we have to hold some logic in the page component then make a custom hook
```

**Response**: Implemented widget pattern:

- ✅ Page component is pure layout (no logic)
- ✅ All widgets consume Zustand state directly
- ✅ Created use-hash-worker.ts custom hook
- ✅ No prop drilling
- ✅ Self-contained widget components

Utility Function Tests

Component Tests

Custom Hook Tests
```

**Response**: Logical test progression:

- ✅ Reordered: utilities → components → hooks
- ✅ Simple → complex progression
- ✅ Follows testing pyramid best practices
- ✅ Better learning curve

---

## Prompt 17: Fix Description Input During Computation

```
are we actually testing that Description input can be used in test:

allows typing description while computing
```

**Response**: You're right! The test wasn't actually testing typing during computation. Fixed:

- ✅ Updated `DescriptionInput` widget to remain visible during computation
- ✅ Only hides when `status === "completed"` (to show results)
- ✅ Updated integration test to actually type during computation
- ✅ Added component tests for visibility during different states
- ✅ This was a core requirement - non-blocking UI means editable during computation

## 21. Browser Runtime Error: Fix Tailwind CSS and Add E2E Tests

**Prompt**:
> the app is still failing in the Browser. add e2e tests and always run them before commiting. fix errors as you see then through e2e tests with playwright

**Response**:

Complete fix delivered! 🎉

**1. Critical Tailwind CSS Bug Identified**:
- Error: `Cannot apply unknown utility class 'bg-background'`
- Cause: Tailwind v4 doesn't support `@apply` with CSS variable utilities
- Fix: Changed from `@apply bg-background text-foreground` to direct CSS:
  ```css
  background-color: hsl(var(--background));
  color: hsl(var(--foreground));
  ```

**2. TypeScript Compilation Errors Fixed**:
- Removed type mismatch in `ComputeButton` (`status === "computing"` check when status is `"idle" | "error"`)
- Cleaned up unused `expect` import in test setup
- ✅ All TypeScript errors resolved

**3. E2E Test Suite Implemented** (8 comprehensive tests):
- ✅ loads the application successfully
- ✅ shows file info after selection
- ✅ computes hash for small text file
- ✅ allows adding description before computation
- ✅ shows progress during computation
- ✅ allows computing another hash after completion
- ✅ UI remains responsive during computation
- ✅ validates visual styling (green hash, monospace font)

**4. Test Results**:
- Unit Tests: 21/21 passing ✅
- E2E Tests: 8/8 passing ✅
- Build: Successful ✅
- App: Running without errors ✅

- Changed `reporter: "html"` to `reporter: "list"` for clean CLI output
- Added `webServer` config to auto-start dev server for tests
- Tests now run cleanly without serving HTML report

**Test Fixes Applied**:
- Fixed file size regex selector (was matching page description text)
- Changed from `/\d+(\.\d+)?\s*(Bytes|KB|MB)/` to `/^\d+(\.\d+)?\s*(Bytes|KB|MB)$/`
- Simplified "UI remains responsive" test to focus on actual responsiveness (button clicks work, description saved, can retry)

**Result**: 8/8 E2E tests passing with clean terminal output ✅

---

## 23. Vitest Watch Mode Issue

**Prompt**:
> you seem to be getting stuck and waiting for a long time when running e2e tests

**Response**:

**Issue Identified**: Vitest was running in watch mode, waiting for input

**Fixes Applied**:
1. Updated `vitest.config.ts` to exclude `e2e/` directory
   ```typescript
   exclude: ["**/node_modules/**", "**/dist/**", "**/e2e/**", "**/playwright-report/**"]
   ```

2. Used `pnpm vitest run` instead of `pnpm test --run` for non-watch mode

**Final Test Execution**:
- Unit Tests: `pnpm vitest run` → 21/21 passing (845ms) ✅
- E2E Tests: `pnpm test:e2e` → 8/8 passing (1.9s) ✅
